# XMegaI2CandSerial
My attempts to get USART and I2C working with Atmel XMega chips. Should work regardless of development environment (AVR Eclipse, Atmel Studio, Makefiles). 
So no dependencies on ASF.

Now working!

Work done mostly during my time at CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere in Battery Point Tas.
